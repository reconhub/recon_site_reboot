Dates can be provided in various standard formats. The class ‘incidence2’ is used to store computed incidence and can be easily manipulated, subsetted, and plotted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutbreaks   Empirical or simulated disease outbreak data, provided either as RData or as text files. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreportfactory   Provides an infrastructure for handling multiple R Markdown reports, including automated curation and time-stamping of outputs, parameterisation and provision of helper functions to manage dependencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrendeval   Provides a coherent interface for evaluating models fit with the trending package. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrending   Provides a coherent interface to multiple modelling tools for fitting trends along with a standardised approach for generating confidence and prediction intervals."

This package is designed to be a lightweight solution to easily switching between week-based date definitions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndistcrete   Creates discretised versions of continuous distribution functions by mapping continuous values to an underlying discrete grid, based on a (uniform) frequency of discretisation, a valid discretisation point, and an integration range. For a review of discretisation methods, see Chakraborty (2015) doi:10.1186/s40488-015-0028-6. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nearlyR   Implements a simple, likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number (R0) using a branching process with a Poisson likelihood. This model requires knowledge of the serial interval distribution, and dates of symptom onsets. Infectiousness is determined by weighting R0 by the probability mass function of the serial interval on the corresponding day. It is a simplified version of the model introduced by Cori et al. (2013) doi:10.1093/aje/kwt133. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepicontacts   A collection of tools for representing epidemiological contact data, composed of case line lists and contacts between cases. Also contains procedures for data handling, interactive graphics, and statistics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepiflows   Provides functions and classes designed to handle and visualise epidemiological flows between locations. Also contains a statistical method for predicting disease spread from flow data initially described in Dorigatti et al. (2017) doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.28.30572. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepitrix   A collection of small functions useful for epidemics analysis and infectious disease modelling. This includes computation of basic reproduction numbers from growth rates, generation of hashed labels to anonymize data, and fitting discretized Gamma distributions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincidence   Provides functions and classes to compute, handle and visualise incidence from dated events for a defined time interval. Dates can be provided in various standard formats. The class ‘incidence’ is used to store computed incidence and can be easily manipulated, subsetted, and plotted. In addition, log-linear models can be fitted to ‘incidence’ objects using ‘fit’. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatchmaker   Provides flexible dictionary-based cleaning that allows users to specify implicit and explicit missing data, regular expressions for both data and columns, and global matches, while respecting ordering of factors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprojections   Provides functions and graphics for projecting daily incidence based on past incidence, and estimates of the serial interval and reproduction number. Projections are based on a branching process using a Poisson-distributed number of new cases per day, similar to the model used for estimating R in ‘EpiEstim’ or in ‘earlyR’, and described by Nouvellet et al. (2017) doi:10.1016/j.epidem.2017.02.012. The package provides the S3 class ‘projections’ which extends ‘matrix’, with accessors and additional helpers for handling, subsetting, merging, or adding these objects, as well as dedicated printing and plotting methods."

On this page, we acknowledge institutions who supported RECON in terms of:\n\ndirect funding: these funders support RECON through direct donations to the organisation, or free/discounted services\nindirect funding: these funders support RECON through means other than direct donations, typically through salaries of members who contribute to RECON activities through their professional activity, or financial support of events\npartners: these are organisations which have been collaborating with RECON to co-organise events such as workshops and short courses\n\n\nDirect funding\nRECON has received the following direct funding:\n\nR Consortium / Linux foundation: USD 23,300 for the COVID-19 challenge project\nZoom: granted free license to the organisation account\n\n\n\nIndirect funding\n\nMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC GIDA)\nBased at Imperial College London and headed by Pr Neil Ferguson, MRC GIDA (MR/R015600/1) has played a key role supporting the emergence of RECON and its activities, by helping us fund various events and supporting salaries of several key members. In particular, it provided the core funding for Hackout 3, which led to the creation of RECON, as well as for our first meeting on outbreak analytics in March 2018.\n\n\nNIHR Health Protection Research Unit for Modelling Methodology (NIHR HPRU MM)\nA structural collaboration between Public Health England and Imperial College London, the NIHR HPRU MM (HPRU-2012-10080) has been established in 2014 with the aim of developing novel analytical and computational tools to improve public health. It has supported events, activities and members salaries since the emergence of RECON. In particular, it funded most of our short course in Sofia and the satelite short course and workshop for the ESCAIDE conference in Malta in 2018.\n\n\nUK Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK-PHRST)\nThe UK-PHRST is a unique collaboration between Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to provide and coordinate the UK’s public health response to outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to the public health response, the UK-PHRST conducts outbreak-related research and capacity building for outbreak response. The UK-PHRST is financed through UK Official Development Assistance funding and supports RECON primarily through salary support of some members and meeting sponsorship.\n\n\n\nPartners\nIn alphabetic order, our partners include:\n\nThe EPIET Alumni Network (EAN)\nThe EAN is a regular partner for co-organising workshops and shot-courses, including satellite events to the ESCAIDE conference and via the support of activities of the EPIET/EUPHEM fellows.\n\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF)\nMSF and RECON collaborate on the development of R4epi, a project aiming to provide new, free and widely accessible resources for field epidemiology.\n\n\nUS Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nThe US CDC funded and co-organised a short course in Atlanta on infectious disease modelling in April 2018.\n\n\nWorld Health Organization - Afro region (WHO Afro)\nWHO Afro has funded and co-organised a short course on outbreak analytics in December 2018."
